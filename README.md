- 3mer_Generator: The purpose of this lab is to test the occurence of the DNA 3 mer 'AAA' in 1000 randomly generated 3 mers when the odds of any given base ('ATCG') being rolled is uniformly distributed and compare it to the occurence under non-uniform distribution.
- Weighted_Alphabet_Generator: The purpose of this lab is to generator two random alphabets given arrays of characters and their weights. The returned alphabet's weight should be within a 0.01 roundoff error of 1.
